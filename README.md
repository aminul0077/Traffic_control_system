# Traffic_control_system
Hardware based project

This system will run automatically. This system is primarily for connecting roads. If the sensor can detect that there is more traffic on a road, then the green light will stay on for a longer period of time than on other roads until the traffic decreases. If an ambulance is coming on a road, the green light will stay on until the ambulance passes.

Components used : Arduino Uno R3, IR sensor, LED light, Resistor, Jumper cable.
